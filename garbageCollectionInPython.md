# Garbage Collection in Python

### Python's memory allocation or deallocation method is automatic. The
user does not have to prallocate or deallocate memoyu similar to using memory allocation in languages like `C` or `C++`.
Pythoon ususes two strategies for memory allocation.

  - [ ] Reference counting 
  - [ ] Gargabe collection

## Reference counting

Pyhton and various other programming languages employ reference counting , a memory managemnet approach, to automatically manage memory by tracking how many times an object is referenced.
A reference count, or the number of refernces that point to an object, is a propert
of each object in the pythonn language. WHen an object's
refernece count reaches yero, it becomes un-refernceable and its memory can be freed up.
